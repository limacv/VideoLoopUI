# 3D Video Loop web demo

This repo contains demos and results for the CVPR 2023 paper: **3D Video Loops from Asynchronous Input**. For more information, please visit the [project webpage](https://limacv.github.io/VideoLoop3D_web/). 

# Usage
If you want to visualize your own 3D video loop (locally), here is what you can do:

1. Clone the repo.

2. Place your data under the ```assets``` folder.

2. Run the ```start_python_server.py```

3. Open your browser, and go to http://localhost:8000. (tested in Safari, Edge and Chrome)

4. In the **data_url** menu, type in your data name (e.g. "assets/fall1"), and click loadscene button. If your data is generated by the official code, you should be able to see your video loop 3D!
